## 🌍 GovTech & Social-Welfare Focus (High-Level)

Under NDAs, I’m building **Government-to-People (G2P) systems** that:

* Consolidate citizen data into single-source-of-truth registries  
* Automate eligibility & benefits workflows for transparent payouts  
* Apply ML (fraud/anomaly detection, smart deduplication) for oversight  
* Run securely on self-hosted Ubuntu to satisfy data-sovereignty mandates  

Open-source stacks · strict compliance · human-centric design.

## 📈 B2B & SaaS Products

* **Invoice & Receipting Web App** – Analytics-first; ML predicts payment-delay risk.  
* **Donation Platform (Zambian market)** – “Buy-Me-a-Coffee” style with seamless mobile-money.  
* **Bulk SMS API** – Cloudflare Workers-powered for high-throughput, low-latency messaging.  
* **E-commerce Solutions** – Inventory-aware e-commerce mobile apps and systems tailored for African MSMEs.

## 📊 Data Visualization & Analytics

| Area | Highlights |
| ---- | ---------- |
| **Scientific Research** | Publication-ready plots (Matplotlib, Seaborn) for ROC curves, confusion matrices, statistical charts. |
| **Business Intelligence** | Interactive dashboards (Plotly, Kibana) surfacing KPIs for finance, sales, and beneficiary-payment lifecycles. |
| **System Metrics** | OpenSearch + Kibana for log aggregation and real-time observability (response-time heatmaps, error-rate alerts, capacity forecasts). |

## 🔄 No-Code Automations

| Tool | Real-World Automations I’ve Shipped |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Zapier** | Social-media cross-posting, lead-capture → CRM, automatic follow-ups based on form feedback, calendar reminders triggered by website events. |
| **Make.com** | Multi-step marketing pipelines: RSS → design templates → scheduled posts; automated outreach emails when new leads appear in Google Sheets or Airtable. |
| **n8n (self-hosted)** | Privacy-friendly workflows: collecting website/social-media feedback → sentiment analysis → Slack alerts; syncing calendars across teams; nightly data enrichment jobs without SaaS limits. |

## 🎨 Design & Motion

* **Graphic Design** – Brand assets, infographics, and marketing collateral in Photoshop, Illustrator, Affinity Photo/Designer, and Canva.  
* **Motion Graphics** – After Effects animations for explainer videos, social ads, and UI micro-interactions.  
* **UX/UI** – Wireframes to hi-fidelity prototypes in Figma, always performance-tested to hit my **400 / 400 Lighthouse obsession**.

---

## 🌀 Creative Coding & Generative Art

Processing, p5.js, and openFrameworks experiments exploring:

* Real-time **music visualizations** synced to MIDI/FFT data  
* **Recursive & fractal art** driven by algorithmic randomness  
* Interactive installations blending computer-vision inputs with generative graphics  

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning & Research

* **Computer Vision** – Post-grad research on image classification and object detection (CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, etc).  
* **End-to-End Pipelines** – Data → pandas/NumPy → TF/PyTorch → FastAPI/DRF model APIs.  
* **Applied ML** – Document verification, QA defect spotting, city-scale traffic analytics.  
* **Academic Publishing** – Crafting research papers and technical docs in **LaTeX** for reproducibility and crisp typography.

## 🌐 Web, CMS, & Performance Craftsmanship

From bespoke React apps to WordPress portals, I **relentlessly chase a perfect 400 / 400 Lighthouse score** (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO) with lazy-loaded assets, SSR, aggressive caching, and UX polish that feels instant even on low-bandwidth links.

---

## 👐 Open-Source & Community

Contributor of fixes, docs, and starter templates—especially in Django, ODK, and DevOps—and sharer of scripts that help others self-host and hit those Lighthouse hundreds.

---

## 💼 Agency & Freelance

Eight-plus years of full-stack delivery (plus countless midnight SSH sessions) powering custom systems, ML integrations, and ultra-fast websites.
